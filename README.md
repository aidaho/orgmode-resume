# Org Mode Resume

Edit the org mode format to suit your needs.
Install LaTeX: `sudo apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra` (Debian)
Then run `bash build.sh`.

If you want to anonimize your name/email/phone/company names, write `#+anon: t` option in the org file.

The template is largely inspired by Jake's resume. If you're interested, feel free to modify `template.tex`.

TODO
- [ ] github actions
- [ ] make anon option available for educational institutions

PRs are welcome to improve this :)
